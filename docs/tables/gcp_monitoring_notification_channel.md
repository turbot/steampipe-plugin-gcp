# Table: gcp_monitoring_notification_channel - Query GCP Monitoring Notification Channels using SQL

GCP Monitoring Notification Channels are a part of Google Cloud Monitoring that allows you to configure where and how you want to receive notifications when incidents occur. These channels can be configured to send notifications via email, SMS, or to third-party services. This enables you to stay informed about the health and performance of your GCP resources and take appropriate actions when predefined conditions are met.

## Table Usage Guide

The `gcp_monitoring_notification_channel` table provides insights into Monitoring Notification Channels within Google Cloud Platform. As a DevOps engineer or system administrator, explore channel-specific details through this table, such as the type of channel, display name, labels, and verification status. Utilize it to manage and monitor your notification channels effectively, ensuring you receive timely alerts about incidents in your GCP resources.

  display_name,
  type,
  verification_status
from
  gcp_monitoring_notification_channel
where
  verification_status <> 'VERIFIED';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  display_name,
  type,
  verification_status
from
  gcp_monitoring_notification_channel
where
  verification_status <> 'VERIFIED' OR verification_status is null;
```

### List of monitoring notification channel which are not enabled

from
  gcp_monitoring_notification_channel
where
  not enabled;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
