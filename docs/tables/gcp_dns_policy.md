# Table: gcp_dns_policy

You can configure one DNS server policy for each Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network. The policy can specify inbound DNS forwarding, outbound DNS forwarding, or both.

Inbound server policy refers to a policy that permits inbound DNS forwarding, and outbound server policy refers to one possible method for implementing outbound DNS forwarding. It is possible for a policy to be both an inbound server policy and an outbound server policy if it implements the features of both.

## Examples
