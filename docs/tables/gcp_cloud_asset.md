# Table: gcp_cloud_asset - Query GCP Cloud Asset using SQL

GCP Cloud Asset is a powerful tool for organizations to maintain visibility and control over their cloud resources, ensuring that they can manage these assets effectively in terms of security, compliance, and operational efficiency.

## Table Usage Guide

The `gcp_cloud_asset` table provides an management system for resources and policies within GCP. It allows users to keep track of their cloud assets across various GCP services.

## Examples

### Basic info

It provides a quick snapshot of all assets in the GCP environment. This is helpful for administrators and cloud architects to get an overview of the resources, their types, and recent updates.

```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  asset_type,
  update_time,
  ancestors
from
  gcp_cloud_asset;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  asset_type,
  update_time,
  ancestors
from
  gcp_cloud_asset;
```

### Get access policy of the resources

This query is particularly useful for administrators and security professionals who need to oversee and manage access policies within a GCP environment. It provides a detailed view of how access is controlled and managed across various cloud assets.

```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  access_policy ->> 'Etag' as access_policy_etag,
  access_policy ->> 'Name' as access_policy_name,
  access_policy ->> 'Parent' as access_policy_parent,
  access_policy -> 'Scopes' as access_policy_scopes
from
  gcp_cloud_asset;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  json_extract(access_policy, '$.Etag') as access_policy_etag,
  json_extract(access_policy, '$.Name') as access_policy_name,
  json_extract(access_policy, '$.Parent') as access_policy_parent,
  json_extract(access_policy, '$.Scopes') as access_policy_scopes
from
  gcp_cloud_asset;
```
