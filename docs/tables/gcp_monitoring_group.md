# Table: gcp_monitoring_group - Query GCP Monitoring Groups using SQL

A Monitoring Group in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a named set of Google Cloud resources identified by a filter. These groups provide a way to monitor and manage the combined behavior of a collection of related resources. They are useful for aggregate analysis and for building higher-level, more abstract collections.

## Table Usage Guide

The `gcp_monitoring_group` table provides insights into Monitoring Groups within Google Cloud Monitoring. As a DevOps engineer, explore group-specific details through this table, including resource type, group name, and associated metadata. Utilize it to uncover information about groups, such as those with specific configurations, the relationships between groups, and the verification of group metrics.

## Examples

### Filter info of each monitoring group

  gcp_monitoring_group;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  display_name,
  filter
from
  gcp_monitoring_group;
```

### List of cluster monitoring groups
