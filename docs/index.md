# GCP + Steampipe

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[GCP](https://cloud.google.com) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to authenticated customers on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. 

For example:

```sql
select
  name,
  location,
  versioning_enabled
from
  gcp_storage_bucket
```

```
+--------------------+----------+--------------------+
| name               | location | versioning_enabled |
+--------------------+----------+--------------------+
| steampipe-io-dev   | us-east1 | false              |
| steampipe-io-stage | us       | false              |
| steampipe-io-prod  | us       | true               |
+--------------------+----------+--------------------+

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest GCP plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install gcp
```

### Credentials

| Item | Description |
| - | - |
| Credentials | configure your [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default) |
| Permissions | Grant the `ReadOnlyAccess` policy to your user or role. |
| Radius | Each connection represents a single GCP project. |
| Resolution |  1. Credentials from the json file specified by the `credential_file` paramater in your steampipe config.<br />2. Credentials from the json file specified by the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.<br />3. Credentials from the default json file location (~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json). |

### Configuration

Installing the latest gcp plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/gcp.spc`) with a single connection named `gcp`:

```hcl
connection "gcp" {
  plugin    = "gcp"
  project   = "my-project"
  credential_file = "~/my-service-account-creds.json"
}
```

## Advanced configuration options

By default, the GCP plugin uses your [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default) to connect to GCP. If you have not set up ADC, simply run gcloud auth application-default login. This command will prompt you to log in, and then will download the application default credentials to ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json.

For users with multiple GCP project and more complex authentication use cases, here are some examples of advanced configuration options:

### Use a service account

Generate and download a JSON key for an existing service account using: [create service account key page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey).

```hcl
connection "gcp_my_other_project" {
  plugin             = "gcp"
  project            = "my-other-project"
  credential_file    = "/home/me/my-service-account-creds.json"
}
```

### Specify multiple projects 
A common configuration is to have multiple connections to different projects, using the same standard ADC Credentials for all connections:

```hcl
connection "gcp_project_aaa" {
  plugin    = "gcp"
  project   = "project-aaa"
}

connection "gcp_project_bbb" {
  plugin    = "gcp"
  project   = "project-bbb"
}

connection "gcp_project_ccc" {
  plugin    = "gcp"
  project   = "project-ccc"
}
```

### Specify static credentials using environment variables 

```sh
export CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT=myproject  
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/my/creds.json
```
