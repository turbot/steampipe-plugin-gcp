## v0.1.1 [2021-02-22]

_Bug fixes_

- Now union query for multiple projects will work if different credential files are used for project connection in config ([#116](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-gcp/issues/116))

- Updated `gcp_storage_bucket` table `labels` field to display value correctly ([#115](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-gcp/issues/115))

## v0.1.0 [2021-02-18]

_What's new?_

- Added support for [connection configuration](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-gcp/blob/main/docs/index.md#connection-configuration). You may specify gcp `project` and `credential_file` for each connection in a configuration file. You can have multiple gcp connections, each configured for a different gcp project.

- If the project id to connect to is not specified in connection configuration file or through `CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT` environment variable. Now plugin will use active project, as returned by the `gcloud config get-value project` command.

_Enhancements_

- Added `location` column to `gcp_compute_image`, `gcp_compute_snapshot` and `gcp_monitoring_notification_channel`, `gcp_pubsub_snapshot`, `gcp_pubsub_subscription` and `gcp_pubsub_topic` tables.
- Added `iamPolicy` column to `gcp_compute_instance` table.
- Added `disabled` and `oauth2_client_id` columns to gcp_service_account table.
